## EXPERIENCE

## Software Engineer II

## F5 Networks, Hyderabad, India Sept 2020 - Jan 2023

- Spearheaded design and implementation of Microservices, leveraging Confd and other components to enhance
    system scalability providing 3 core features to customers, resulting in a better overall user experience.
- Developed and deployed a robust gRPC server, providing API access to network statistics from every tenant on a
    multi-tenant device, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis, resulting in enhanced user experience and greater
    visibility.
- Designed upgrade functionality for a multi-tenant device making updates a breeze and allowed for atomic
    upgrades and rollback feature preserving important configurations reducing time required for upgrade by 70%.

## Backend Engineering Intern

## Zendrive, Bangalore, India July 2019 - Dec 2019

- Architected a data collection framework to fetch data from AWS Redshift, Elasticsearch, and Salesforce, to
    streamline data extraction and ingestion into BigQuery, enabling analytics team to monitor user metrics, identify
    emerging trends.
- Created slack bot to query and get notifications for jenkins pipelines reducing load on jenkins server by 20% for
    getting info on running pipelines.
- Revamped and optimized internal Flask API, resolving 3 critical bugs resulting in improved overall system
    performance.

## PROJECTS

- **KV Store** | _Go_ | _Raft Consensus_ | _Distributed Systems_
    Developed a fault-tolerant key-value store in Go using Raft consensus for distributed systems. Ensured data
    integrity and scalability with robust fault handling and leader election mechanisms.
- **Modernizing XV6 OS: Enhanced Functionality** | _C, Assembly_ | _XV6 OS_ | _Operating Systems development_
    Enhanced XV6 OS with modern features including a custom bootloader, on-demand paging for efficient memory
    management, a user thread library for multi-threading support, and a virtual machine monitor for enhanced
    system virtualization capabilities.
- **Rust LSM/SST Tree Implementation** | _Rust_ | _LSM/SST Tree_ | _Data Storage_
    Developed a high-performance LSM/SST Tree index in Rust, optimizing data retrieval and storage. Integrated
    bloom filters to efficiently identify non-existent keys, enhancing overall performance and efficiency.
- **Video Transcoding & Face Recognition with Lambda** | _Python_ | _AWS S3, Lambda, DynamoDB_ | _Face Recognition_
    Built a seamless video transcoding and face recognition pipeline using AWS services. Upon user video upload to
    Amazon S3, triggers AWS Lambda functions for transcoding and face recognition, storing results efficiently in
    DynamoDB for further analysis and retrieval.
- **PDF Text Summarization & Querying with LLM Model** | _PyTorch, Langchain_ | _Colab, Huggingface_ | _Mixtral AI_
    Developed a text summarization and querying system for PDF documents using a fine-tuned LLM model. Utilized
    Streamlit UI for user interaction, with backend support from PyTorch, Langchain, Hugging Face, and Mixtral AI.
    Stored and retrieved document embeddings efficiently with Vector-store.
